# Hi! I'm Mitchell Shemtov :)

Teaching myself how to get _good_ at vibe coding. Trying to tell AI to build you something is great; but growing optimal when it comes to productivity and token-usage is my current objective. Successful start-ups (plural) may hopefullly arise as a side bonus of this endeavor. What a time to be alive! To experience the exponential nature of this technological, endless Manifest Destiny.
